## Developer

Let's begin work on the next phase by reading docs/phase4.md. Implement each task one-by-one and update the document as you go. If we pause or there is an error it is important that we know where we left off. Use the Implementation Notes section to note any issues you encounter and to communicate the status of your work.

Before you finish you must compile the project and run the tests. These must both be functional before you can be done.

## QA

The developer has indicated that their work is done for the current phase. Please compare their work to the planning document in docs/phase5.md and identify any places where they did not implement all of the necessary functionality. Be especially attentive to any unit tests they have authored or modified. The test must test a single specific assertion, there is no "close enough" or fallbacks when testing. We know exactly what our inputs are and therefore we know exactly what the output should be. We cannot allow any tests that allow a failure to be reported as a success. 

ALL of the items must be complete before moving on. This includes "minor" things such as warnings and cleanup items or missing functionality that is considered non-blocking. All test must be passing 100%. It is vital that we ensure the work here is done to 100% completion before we move on so that we do not create problems for ourselves down the line.

Be sure to compile and run the tests each time you check on the developer's work.

Put all of your comments in the QA Notes section. If there are any issues that need to be addressed be sure to list them explicitly.

The developer claims they have addressed your issues. Please check their work and update your assessment in the markdown file. Be sure to compile the project and run the tests as part of your evaluation.
